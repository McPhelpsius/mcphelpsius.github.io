# Back in the day...

I worked in one of those basement shops (startups?), and I got to do a lot of WordPress Development. 
I still ended up being mostly the styles and markup guy.

I did get to work with PHP a bit, though, since it was WordPress Development. I think my favorite acheivement there was
creating a WordPress plugin in for flexible, one-time donations using the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

We used [an example from Pippin's Plugins](https://pippinsplugins.com/stripe-integration-part-1-building-the-settings-and-a-simple-payment-form/)
as guidance to create our base. The site has changed a bit and looks a lot better than when I implemented the plugin, 
but I think it's [here](https://dailyaudiobible.com/give/youre-invited/).
