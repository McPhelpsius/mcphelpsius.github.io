#Effective Immediately:
I am taking down all of my filler posts. Most of them are nonsense anyways.

This is my site... for now. I know it is ugly, but just like any parent with a hideous baby I will be ignoring that fact. I will continue going on and letting the kid "grow into his nose and ears" (thanks mom and dad ).

I will be posting just about anything that interests me here. It will mostly code stuff, but if I ever get a good idea (every other year, so here is 2016!) I will post it. I will do some link dumping, as well as sharing things I learn and linking to things I have done before.

So the site is a little incomplete, but I just need to remove a bit of filler and placeholderiness (pretty sure Webster will [add this to his dictionary](http://nws.merriam-webster.com/opendictionary/newword_display_recent.php) after this post, next to "anchor baby", "Minecraftology", and "adorkable"). The site could obviously use some consistent styling, actual design, and *less ugliness*, but that is still to come.

First Step:

> I am taking down all of my filler posts.

As I had said before, because

> Most of them are nonsense anyways.

Except for the one about my wife being hot, because she is.

After that:
1. Add content, possibly at an intense rate.
 >> I am taking down all of my filler posts.

 It will make my site look empty if I don't put content in. In fact, I need to make this post longer, so here is an image. ![unsplash image](https://unsplash.it/1200/600)

2. Whittle away at the design. I didn't actually design this (can you tell), but I know it is ugly. I might add color, and I will **definitely** change the fonts.

3. Show off what I can do, and ramble about things I learned.

4. Not ignore my wife, friends, and family to blog all the time. I take pride on those things.

Anyways, if you're reading this, I probably know you. So, I love you (there, I said it, David), and thanks for reading my blog.
