title: Slow, Minor Improvements to the Site
layout: post
---

Okay, okay! I know it has been slow, and honestly this blog is just inner dialogue anyways, but I've heard you! I feel your complaints!

The site look a little better now. The fonts are different (*only one is being used right now*), and we added two different colors for links. I've continued tweaking layout a bit, so things look a tad better. I also added some better alignment and padding throughout.

If you look to the footer, you'll see an actual live link to one of my actual projects, my **favorite**, actually. I have to thank Github Pages for free hosting and an easily maintained blog.
