title: Bouncy Ball Form Validation
layout: post

I made this one for fun, but it also let me understand different form input types better, as well as their validation.
The idea was to show when your input has qualified or unqualified itself as your type. If your email doesn't look like an
email, the ball turns red, and if you try to submit it, the ball will bounce.

You should change the CodePen viewport to side-by-side as opposed to stacked, or you might have a headache.
