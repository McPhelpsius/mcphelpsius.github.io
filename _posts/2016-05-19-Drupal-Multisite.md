title: Vance Publishing Drupal Multisite

I began work at a publishing corporation. A *paper* publishing corporation. They still print and sell *paper* magazines on ***paper**.

## The year was 2015...

I give them a hard time. but it's still for real. The company owner didn't value technology, and that was reflected in the way they made their website decisions.
So they outsourced their sites to the lowest bidder in Chicago got what they paid for: a very expensive Drupal Multi-Multi Site. 
It's as complex as it sounds, but not as complicated. They wanted a base site that served 4 types of site, that other sites would be based on.

The issue with the expensive multi-multi site was that it looked bad, wasn't programmed well, and the budget was running out. Lowest bidders selected by paper-based
periodical companies aren't vetted well. There were lots of hard-coded switch statments, terrible design decisions, and *way* to many undeveloped features left over.
So they brought in the big boys (Me and one other direct hire with less than a year of Drupal between us).

Here's a list of some of the sites:

- http://www.salontoday.com/
- http://www.porknetwork.com/
- http://www.cattlenetwork.com/
- http://www.produceretailer.com/
- http://www.thepacker.com/
- http://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/
- http://www.woodworkingtechnology.com/

I'm sure as you look it becomes very apparent that there are a lot of similar styles. That's a multi-multi sote for you, friend.

It looked **terrible** when we got it. It looked like someone gave a ten year old a mobile device and proxima nova 
and told them to run the company for a year. So one of the in-house desiginers drew up a whole new redesign to fix the sites, 
so that desktop users wouldn't be forced to click on a hamburger icon to get to a menu. I could go on for a while about how we had to reduce
the amount of [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) used on the site (it was everywhere!).

It was a lot of fun, honestly. I was unleashed to use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) after petitioning enough.
I got to explore the endless world of Drupal modules, get [Drupalized](https://drupalize.me/), and experience [Drupal Corn](http://2016.drupalcorn.org/).
