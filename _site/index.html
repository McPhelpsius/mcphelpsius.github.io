        Simple Deck of Cards

      <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2016</span>

      <p>This is my little pet project right now, and I have been writing it with ES6 objects. It has been a ton of fun. I want
to make a deck of cards that can play <strong><em>any</em></strong> card game that the players choose to play, which requires 
practically infinite flexibility.</p>

      <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2016</span>

      <p>I made this one for fun, but it also let me understand different form input types better, as well as their validation.
The idea was to show when your input has qualified or unqualified itself as your type. If your email doesn’t look like an
email, the ball turns red, and if you try to submit it, the ball will bounce.</p>

      <p>I took a job with AceInfo, a government contractor who develops with the NOAA. This is the most interesting work I’ve done to date,
probably because I got in a little above my skill level. It was a lot of fun though. Below is a bunch of code I did on a project using
OpenLayers 3 and ESRI Maps. Enjoy!</p>

      <p>While working at Vance Publishing, I ran into a few challenges that made work more interesting to me.
There was a good patch of maybe 2-3 months where it felt like I was doing the same thing <em>everyday</em> (which I was), and it was getting old.
So I appreciated the chance to take on the following task:</p>

      <p>I worked in one of those basement shops (startups?), and I got to do a lot of WordPress Development. 
I still ended up being mostly the styles and markup guy.</p>
