<p>I am taking down all of my filler posts. Most of them are nonsense anyways.</p>

<p>This is my site… for now. I know it is ugly, but just like any parent with a hideous baby I will be ignoring that fact. I will continue going on and letting the kid “grow into his nose and ears” (thanks mom and dad ).</p>

<p>I will be posting just about anything that interests me here. It will mostly code stuff, but if I ever get a good idea (every other year, so here is 2016!) I will post it. I will do some link dumping, as well as sharing things I learn and linking to things I have done before.</p>

<p>So the site is a little incomplete, but I just need to remove a bit of filler and placeholderiness (pretty sure Webster will <a href="http://nws.merriam-webster.com/opendictionary/newword_display_recent.php">add this to his dictionary</a> after this post, next to “anchor baby”, “Minecraftology”, and “adorkable”). The site could obviously use some consistent styling, actual design, and <em>less ugliness</em>, but that is still to come.</p>

<p>First Step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am taking down all of my filler posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I had said before, because</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of them are nonsense anyways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for the one about my wife being hot, because she is.</p>

<p>After that:
1. Add content, possibly at an intense rate.
 » I am taking down all of my filler posts.</p>

<p>It will make my site look empty if I don’t put content in. In fact, I need to make this post longer, so here is an image. <img src="https://unsplash.it/1200/600" alt="unsplash image" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Whittle away at the design. I didn’t actually design this (can you tell), but I know it is ugly. I might add color, and I will <strong>definitely</strong> change the fonts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show off what I can do, and ramble about things I learned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not ignore my wife, friends, and family to blog all the time. I take pride on those things.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, if you’re reading this, I probably know you. So, I love you (there, I said it, David), and thanks for reading my blog.</p>
