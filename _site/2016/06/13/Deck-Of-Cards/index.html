  <h1 class="post-title">Simple Deck of Cards</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Jun 2016</span>
  <p>This is my little pet project right now, and I have been writing it with ES6 objects. It has been a ton of fun. I want
to make a deck of cards that can play <strong><em>any</em></strong> card game that the players choose to play, which requires 
practically infinite flexibility.</p>

<p>The goal is to be able to have a deck of cards available to you in your pocket at all times (<em>eventually a mobile app</em>).
Right now you can pick which cards are in your game, which suits, decide if Aces are high or low,
how many players are playing, and their names by submitting a form. It won&#39;t currently work on CodePen
if your window has a query string, so check for that if you are view on CodePen.</p>

<p>Players can play their cards by clicking, and the card will leave their hand and go into the game&#39;s discard pile (not represented visually).
The code lives on my machine in a more organized file structure, and is currently a few development steps ahead of
the Pen, but feel free to ask and I would love to show it off or get constructive crititcism.</p>

<p>This is written completely in vanilla JavaScript without any libraries, which is a personal vendetta of mine that often
leads to JavaScript headaches. I like to know what I&#39;m actually doing under the hood, so I choose to code without libraries sometimes.</p>
